## Introduction
* The goal is to examine the relationship between family background, race and the current income of developers in the tech industry around the world. For that purpose, three (3) questions were posed and answered: </br>

    1. How does the annual income of developers vary between ethnic groups?
    2. Do student developers of these backgrounds also have different salary expectations from their peers?
    3. Are you likely to earn more if either of your parents graduated from college?
        
* The dataset used is the 2017 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey results. Visit this <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017> page </a> for all the information concerning the data gathering technique, the questions and respondents. 
* Special attention was paid to Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) in the analysis

## Installations 
The only package required to run the code is the Anaconda Distribution of Python. Any Python version above 3.0 should work. If you don't have the anaconda distribution installed on your local machine, click <a href=https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual> here </a> to install


## File Descriptions 
* `EthnicDiversity......ipynb` is the iPython Notebook containing the steps followed in the analysis. 
* `.py` is a python script containing the functions defined for the purpose of the analysis



## Results
In the end, I found that:

a. Native American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian and White or European developers earn more than everyone else while South Asians earn the least.
b. Students learning to code that are of White or European and East Asian ancestries have higher salary expectations than every other ethnic group. 
c. Developers with a parent having at least a Bachelor's degree generally tend to earn more than developers whose parents are less educated.

You can find more details about the result in my medium blog post here.
