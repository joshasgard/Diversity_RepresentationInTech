# Diversity_RepresentationInTech

## Introduction
* The goal is to examine the relationship between family background, race and the current income of developers in the tech industry around the world. 
* The dataset used is the 2017 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey results. Visit this <a href=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017> page </a> for all the information concerning the data gathering technique, the questions and respondents.
